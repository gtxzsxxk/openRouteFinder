Place newer navigational data for the global database in THIS folder.
If you want to replace any of X-Plane's
earth_nav.dat
earth_awy.dat
earth_fix.dat
earth_hold.dat
earth_msa.dat
earth_mora.dat
or
CIFP/*
with newer data, then place them HERE IN THIS FOLDER to avoid conflicts with the X-Plane updater.

Note that this database is also used by X-Plane’s GPS and previously needed files in other subfolders are now ignored.


Also, you can place the FAACIFP18 file here, which you can get from the FAA website: https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/cifp/ 
If the file FAACIFP18 is found in this folder, X-Plane will load instrument flight procedures from this file.
